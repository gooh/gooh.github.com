From [May 18th to May 21st I was at DPC][10] in lovely Amsterdam. The line-up for this
conference promised a lot of interesting talks and good networking opportunities.
So I had to go.

## Hotel

The speaker hotel for DPC11 was the ibis Hotel at Amsterdam Central Station.
I considered staying there at first, but this was about 6km from the conference
venue and (like any other hotel in downtown Amsterdam) it was quite expensive.

So I ended up in the [CitizenM Hotel][11], which is a pretty fancy design hotel with
rather small (no separate bathroom), but efficiently designed and quiet rooms.
The bed was spacious and comfortable. Geeks will love the Philips mood pad that
allows controlling various aspects of the room, like TV, blinds, air condition
and lighting (including color). They also offer a huge list of free movies and
WiFi is complimentary as well.

## Venue

The [RAI conference center was about 10 minutes walk through Beatrixpark from CitizenM][12].
There is not much to say about the venue, which in this case means, it was well chosen.
The WiFi worked well. The rooms were large enough to accomodate the PHP Crowd
at the various talks. The main hall allowed for easy socializing. Some rooms
were bit too cold at times.

### Catering

I just might be a spoiled german here, but I was a bit disappointed by the
catering. There was sandwiches, warm pastry and Hot Dogs for lunch, which I was
told is pretty common for Dutch lunch. Unfortunately, the warm food was only
available in very limited quantities. So, if you didnt get to the food stands
immediately you were left with the sandwiches (which I wasn't too fond of).
The only good thing about this was you couldn't fall into a post-meal coma and since
I wasn't there for the food anyways it's just a minor complaint.

### Workshop

Prior to the conference, there was a full day of workshops. Attendees got a free copy
of [thePHP.cc's QA book][13], which was a rather nice
and very much unexpected gift, especially since I didn't own that yet and had
it on my wishlist.

I attended ["XP Principles and Practices" by Sebastian Schürmann][14].
I already knew the theory behind XP, but the workshop helped me deepen and
solidify my knowledge and helped close some gaps. The presenter did a good
job moderating the workshop in a way that encouraged active participation
of all attendees. There was a tremendous amount of experience shared this way.

## Conference Day 1

The main conference started with [Aral Balkan's keynote about "The Art of User Experience: making beautiful, delightful, fun things"][1]. While UX might not
be a too obvious thing to think about when you are in the bowels of a PHP
backend, Aral delivered an absolutely stunning and professional keynote that
got the argument across in an entertaining, enthusiastic and inspiring manner.

After the keynote I attended [Oracle's Christopher Jones talk about Developing and Deploying High Performance PHP Applications][2]. The talk had an (expected)
sales-pitch nature, but I found it valuable to get an overview of current and
upcoming Oracle Techologies I might want to look more deeply into. As such,
the talk wasn't so much about "How" but about "What with" and offered only
very little technical details. And I got a free USB Stick, so yay!

Since I recently read "REST In Practise" and "RESTful Web Service", I was keen
to attend [Evert Pot's session "So you think you know REST?"][3] then.
Unfortunately, the talk focused way too much on various HTTP features and was
very dry. I missed information about Resources, Representations, Richardson's
Maturity Model, the role of Hypermedia (HATEOAS) and how REST enables us to
build Domain Application Protocols.

After the lunch break I attended [Jonas Marien's "Implementing Comet using PHP"][5].
Whenever I researched Comet for PHP in the past, I came to the conclusion that
PHP isn't that well suited for it. I had hoped to gain some new insight on the topic,
but the talk mainly offered a (very thorough) overview of available Comet
technologies in general and not so much about the problems faced when wanting to
do Comet in PHP. So the title was somewhat of a misnomer.

For the final session on that day I attended [Rob Allen's "Zend Framework 2.0: what's new and what's changed?"][4]. This was a good talk that delivered what
it promised. As I dont follow the ZF2 development too closely it was good to
learn that a number of things that bug me in ZF1 are on the ToDo list for
improvement in ZF2.

### Socializing Event

The [socializing event][15] was scheduled from 2030 to 2300 in Club NL in downtown
Amsterdam. Unfortunately, that venue didnt work for me at all. The place was
way too small to accomodate all the attendees and it was definitely too noisy
to socialize without yelling at each other. I left early.

## Conference Day 2

The second day at DPC11 started with the [Helgi Þormar Þorbjörnsson keynote about "First Class APIs"][16]. Helgi emphasized the growing
importance of making Data available on the web via dedicated APIs. While this was
a solid keynote it paled in comparison to the furious keynote Aral Balkan delivered
on the first day. I also felt it was rather lengthy with the main argument being
sufficiently explained after about half of the keynote.

The first session I attended that day was [Juozas "Joe" Kaziukėnas "The new era of PHP frameworks"][6]. I didnt always get who Joe was refering to when he
said "we" but the talk gave a good overview over the current state of PHP
frameworks and what to expect from the next generation of PHP frameworks.
Some of what was suggested as desirable features in next-gen frameworks was
rather opinionated in my book and debatable (just add beer) but unfortunately,
there wasnt enough time to do so.

When I left Rob Allen's ZF2 outlook the day before, I had asked him about a
specific problem I was currently facing in one of my ZF projects and he invited
me to his talk ["Optimising a Zend Framework application"][7]. This was a very
well done talk offering plenty of good practical advice (beyond what is already
offered in the ZF Performance Guide) to take home.

After that I attended [Qafoo's "Modular Application Architecture"][17]. Kore
Nordmann and Tobias Schlitt presented different solutions to this problem and
compared them. The talk covered a lot in a very short time, which made it
sometimes hard to follow. For the short 45 minutes at DPC it might have made
sense to just focus on an overview and leave out the obscure real world examples
of Oxid and PHPBB. Still, a good talk.

The last talk for this day was [David Zuelke's "Large-Scale Data Processing with Hadoop and PHP"][8]. David is a very entertaining speaker with a skill to sell
technologies to you in a very short time. Unfortunately, he had a headache this
day and wasn't as jumpy as usual. But even with this slight handicap, David
delivered a professional and rock solid, well structured introduction to
Hadoop and HadooPHP with some live demos.

The [closing keynote of DPC11 was held by Cal Evans][9]. Cal talked about what
managers should know and do if they want developers to exhibit the same
passion and enthusiasm towards their jobs than they show for open source
projects they work on in their spare time. Though I am not sure I'd subscribe
to all what was said, this was a solid and entertaining keynote with a clear message.

## Conclusion

All in all, I really enjoyed DPC a lot. There was plenty of interesting topics
to pick from. And despite the failed Social Event, I still had my share
of socializing and networking between sessions. DPC11 was a rather valuable
conference for me and I am looking forward to come back here next year.

Thanks to everyone who made this happen.
